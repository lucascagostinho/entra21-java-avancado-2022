# Errors and Exceptions
> Error refers to an illegal operation performed by the user which results in the abnormal working of the program. Programming errors often remain undetected until the program is compiled or executed. Some of the errors inhibit the program from getting compiled or executed. Thus errors should be removed before compiling and executing. 


## Types
* Compile-time;
* Run-time;
* Logical.

# Exceptions

> Whereas exceptions in java refer to an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions.

## User-defined Custom Exception in Java
Java provides us the facility to create our own exceptions which are basically derived classes of Exception. Creating our own Exception is known as a custom exception or user-defined exception. Basically, Java custom exceptions are used to customize the exception according to user needs. In simple words, we can say that a User-Defined Exception or custom exception is creating your own exception class and throwing that exception using the ‘throw’ keyword.


## Why use custom exceptions?
* To catch and provide specific treatment to a subset of existing Java exceptions.
* Business logic exceptions: These are the exceptions related to business logic and workflow. It is useful for the application users or the developers to understand the exact problem.
