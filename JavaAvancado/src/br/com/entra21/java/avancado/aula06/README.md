# Generics in Java

> Generics means parameterized types. The idea is to allow type (Integer, String, … etc., and user-defined types) to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces. Using Generics, it is possible to create classes that work with different data types. An entity such as class, interface, or method that operates on a parameterized type is a generic entity.

## Types of Java Generics

* Generic Method

Generic Java method takes a parameter and returns some value after performing a task. It is exactly like a normal function, however, a generic method has type parameters that are cited by actual type. This allows the generic method to be used in a more general way. The compiler takes care of the type of safety which enables programmers to code easily since they do not have to perform long, individual type castings.

* Generic Classes

A generic class is implemented exactly like a non-generic class. The only difference is that it contains a type parameter section. There can be more than one type of parameter, separated by a comma. The classes, which accept one or more parameters, ​are known as parameterized classes or parameterized types.

* Generic Functions
   
We can also write generic functions that can be called with different types of arguments based on the type of arguments passed to the generic method. The compiler handles each method.

Example:

```java

// Java program to show working of user defined
// Generic functions
  
class Test {
    // A Generic method example
    static <T> void genericDisplay(T element)
    {
        System.out.println(element.getClass().getName()
                           + " = " + element);
    }
  
    // Driver method
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Calling generic method with Integer argument
        genericDisplay(11);
  
        // Calling generic method with String argument
        genericDisplay("GeeksForGeeks");
  
        // Calling generic method with double argument
        genericDisplay(1.0);
    }
}
```
